EmojiSearch

Description

This project serves as an introduction to ReactJS, designed to familiarize you with the fundamental concepts of this powerful JavaScript library. The main goal is to fetch data from a JSON file and display it in an interactive user interface.

The project focuses on creating a simple emoji search application, where users can type into a search field to filter and display only the emojis that match their query.

Features

JSON Data Retrieval: We fetch a list of emojis from a JSON file and display them on the page.
Dynamic Display: All emojis are displayed to the user as soon as the page loads.
Real-time Search: As the user types into the search field, the list of emojis is filtered in real-time to show only those that match the search.

Technologies Used

ReactJS: To build the dynamic user interface.
JavaScript: For handling display logic and filtering.
CSS: For styling the application.
JSON: To store the emoji data.
